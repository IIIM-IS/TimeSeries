# TimeSeries
Various computations for time series.

This sub-project springs from our research into pattern detection using time
series datasets. Specifically the Nox EEG datasets.
From it a we explored various features regarding time series, including how to
compute various entropies. One such entropy, Permutation Entropy, was of
additional interest as we believe that a novel processing approach can be
introduced to speed up certain computations, as well as simplify the code base.
